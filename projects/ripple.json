        "Ripple was a project made with teammates for UofTHacks X",
        "Ripple was designed in Figma by a teammate and transfered over into React. My contributions involve implementing a co:here API for Natural Language Processing in the project and designing the backend with Flask and SQL",
        "With a theme of exploration for the hackathon, Ripple was used to help the user explore themselves and their community. Users will look for events in their local area that relate to a topic of choice, but this doesn't allow for the user to explore different passions and hobbies. Ripple will use NLP to decipher and classify some prompt and then generate similar events that follow a different theme to help users diversify.",

        "You can find Ripple and it's source code by clicking the project header to get redirected to the github."
