**MakeUofT 2023 - Best Use of Qualcomm 8450HDK Award Winner**

Created a magnetic coil gun by applying fundamental electromagnetics with a team, and I leveraged the DSP and eAI platform of the Snapdragon 8450 to efficiently detect lifeless objects for the targeting system.

This project combined principles of electromagnetics with embedded AI and computer vision to create an intelligent targeting system for a coil gun. The system used the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8450's digital signal processing capabilities and embedded AI platform to detect and track targets automatically.

**Key Features:**
- Electromagnetic coil gun design using fundamental physics principles
- Real-time object detection and tracking using embedded AI
- Computer vision system for target acquisition
- Integration with Qualcomm Snapdragon 8450 HDK

**Technologies Used:** Electromagnetics, Embedded AI, Computer Vision, DSP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 8450, Python, C++

This project demonstrated the intersection of traditional physics principles with modern embedded AI and computer vision technologies, earning recognition for the best use of the Qualcomm hardware development kit.
