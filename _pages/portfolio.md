## Featured Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills in software development, hardware design, AI/ML, and embedded systems.

### Hardware & Embedded Systems

#### [Magnetic Accelerator - Coil Gun Project]({% post_url 2023-03-15-magnetic-accelerator-coil-gun %})
**MakeUofT 2023 - Best Use of Qualcomm 8450HDK Award Winner**

Created a magnetic coil gun by applying fundamental electromagnetics with a team, and I leveraged the DSP and eAI platform of the Snapdragon 8450 to efficiently detect lifeless objects for the targeting system.

*Technologies: Electromagnetics, Embedded AI, Computer Vision, DSP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 8450*

### Software & Full-Stack Development

#### [Ripple - Discover Your Passions and Local Community]({% post_url 2023-10-20-ripple-discover-passions-community %})
**UofTHacks X Project**

An intelligent tool that helps users explore their passions and local community by expanding local events/communities joined.

*Technologies: React, Flask, Python, SQL, NLP, Cohere API, Figma*

#### [RenTogether - Multiplayer VN Experience]({% post_url 2023-11-15-rentogether-multiplayer-vn-experience %})
